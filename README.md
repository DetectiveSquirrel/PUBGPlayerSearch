# PUBG Player Searcher
* Searches players with a C# wrapper for PUBG stats API
* C# Wrapper https://github.com/eklypss/PUBGSharp
* API provided by https://pubgtracker.com

## Notes
* Inserting wrong API Key will result in Crash/Error
* Searching invalid player will result in Crash/Error
* All Settings selected are saved so you don't have to change them every time you re-open the application
* You must use your own API key from https://pubgtracker.com/site-api as I don't want mine being known

## Getting API key
You can get your API key from here: https://pubgtracker.com/site-api  
Paste the API Key into the API Key box
